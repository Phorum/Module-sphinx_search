Module  : Sphinx Full Text Search
Version : 0.9.5

This module implements a search system that is based on the Sphinx
full text search engine. Sphinx can be downloaded and installed from
http://sphinxsearch.com/


Requirements:
-------------

To get this module to work, you will need to install the Sphinx system
on your server. This will normally not be possible in a shared hosting
environment (because most shared hosting providers won't allow you to
install extra third party software) and no, there is no workaround for that.

You will also need to be able to run scheduled jobs (a.k.a. "cron jobs"
on UNIX system) on the server for updating the search indexes periodically.


Installation:
-------------

- First, you will have to install the Sphinx software. You can either
  install this from some binary package or you can build it yourself from
  the source package. Which way you choose, is up to you. For more
  information on Sphinx and installing it, see http://www.sphinxsearch.com/

- After installing Sphinx, you have to generate the configuration file
  for Sphinx. A script is provided to help you with this task. Run this
  script on the command prompt:

    $ cd /path/to/your/phorum/mods/sphinx_search
    $ php install_helper.php

  Go over the settings and change them to your likings. The most important
  one is the DATAPATH setting. The directory that you enter here should be
  writable for the user that is going to index the database and the user
  that is going to run the Sphinx "searchd" program. After you are done
  with the settings, let the script generate the configuration file.
  It will tell you in where it has stored the generated file.

  If you choose to enable USE_DELTA_UPDATES, an additional table is
  required in the Phorum database. The install helper script can
  automatically create this table for you.

- Move the generated configuration file to a useful location on the server.
  You might for example use "/etc/sphinx.conf" on a UNIX system.

- Before starting Sphinx for the first time, you need to build an initial
  set of index files. See the Sphinx documentation for the "indexer"
  program for more information on the indexing process. On my Linux system,
  I used the following command:

    $ /opt/sphinx/bin/indexer --config /etc/sphinx.conf --all

- Now, the Sphinx "searchd" program can be started up. This is the program
  that will accept search queries and will return the search results
  to Phorum. I used the following command:

    $ /opt/sphinx/bin/searchd --config /etc/sphinx.conf

- At this point, you should be able to use the Sphinx search module in
  Phorum. First go to Phorum's admin "Modules" screen and enable the
  Sphinx search module. Then try a search query on your Phorum install.

============================================================================

some caveats:
  - data is stored in both phorum_search-table (not needed here) and in the
    sphinx filesystem - this doubles the sizes needed for search even though
    the search-table is not needed. You can clear it out every now and then.
  - search-data is not updated in real-time - sphinx reindexes the data if
    the indexer is called for the index, which does a full reindexing of
    the sphinx index. There is a workaround available in sphinx
    http://sphinxsearch.com/doc.html#live-updates which works essentially
    with two indexes. A large one and smaller one with only the deltas
    to the full index and which can be reindexed therefore more often,
    but I don't use that method yet. Still, its not realtime. For me the
    full indexing of 350,000 messages took around 5 minutes. I'd run the
    full indexing around once a day with those times.

Before you can run a search through sphinx you will need to setup sphinx
correctly and do at least one full indexing of your phorum-data.
Try the searching on the command-line using search from the sphinx install
first. Also you will need to start searchd from sphinx so that the mod can
connect to it for searching.
