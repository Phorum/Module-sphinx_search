This directory contains some example scripts that might be useful for
running Sphinx and for updating the indexes. These are only unsupported
examples, which might need to be changed for your specific needs / system.

Available scripts are:

* sphinx
  Can be installed in /etc/init.d/sphinx for starting up the searchd.

* sphinx.indexer
  Used for (re)building the search indexes.
